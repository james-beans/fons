# fons
A game engine written in [LUA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)) using [LÖVR](https://github.com/bjornbytes/lovr).

## Features:
- [x] Written in [LUA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language))
- [x] Using an expandable framework ([LÖVR](https://github.com/bjornbytes/lovr)) as base

## Projects using Fons Engine:
See [the USES.md file](/USES.md) for a list.

## Documentation
- All [documentation is in the DOCS.md file](/DOCS.md).

## Disclamer:
- I will not be supporting MacOS. It might work but I will not add it at all.
- The Github Wiki feature will not be used at all. You will find the docs from this file or the official website (coming soon maybe).
- Documentation will not be made for any component apart from the name, already made projects using the said component and the components code itself.
- You will need to figure out a way to add things yourself after reading [the lövr documentation](https://lovr.org) and this documentation.
- I recommend to look through [the list of components from the ec/readme.md file](/src/ec/README.md) before making your own components.
    - For example don't make your own coloured-text printing, use [the colourprint.lua component](/src/ec/fons/base/utils/colourprint.lua).

## TO-DO list:
- [x] Start making this
- [x] Add more components
- [x] Make a working starting point
- [ ] Finish making main template project
- [ ] Map/level system support
- [ ] Trench-broom support
